            <div class="info-p1">
              <p> I was born on June 18, 2004. Residing at Cagayan de Oro City. I do really love thrifting clothes because it helps me boost my confidence when I wear something that suits my mood in a certain day.</p>
              <p> I'm still undecided with my course back then that's why I choose IT since there are lots of people who are convincing me to try this course. I'm hoping that I can survive this course until the end because to be honest i'm having a hard time learning this website.</p>
              <p> Someday I want to have a stable job with high salary because I want to spoil myself and my family. I want to travel different countries so I can live my life to the fullest.</p>

            <div class="info-p2">
              <p>We are 5 member family. I am the oldest among the siblings. My mother works at Mall as a Cashier in a appliances store. My father works as a freelancer in a car accessories shop.</p>
              <p>I have one younger brother which is currently a grade 11 senior high school student at Liceo de Cagayan University. Meanwhile my younger sister is currently a grade 5 student at Pedro Oloy N. Roa Sr. Elementary School.</p>
              <p>I'm so blessed that we are still together. This photo of us were taken during christmas. Although there are times that we don't get along with each other but I still loved my family. I will make sure that I can provide for them if I finish this course through God's will.</p>

              <p>This course is not easy but because of them my college experience is one of the memorable. These people are my classmates, i'm forever greatful that I met them. We spend our time together in some various activities and hangouts. </p>
              <p>I hope for the best to these people, I manifest that we all graduate soon because I know we really do our best in this course and put some efforts to do such activies. </p>
